# Calculator

Live: https://annagaskell.github.io/Calculator/

This project really helped me work on two major issues I have been having in my work; not enough effort into css and not breaking work down into smaller functions. 

I really enjoyed taking my time to create a beautiful looking project. Even something as simple as adding transition and box shadows to my buttons really made it stand out more and look very realistic. I opted to not to a CSS grid as I already did one with my last project. I instead choose to use flexbox to set up the buttons. I'm looking forward to implementing these new skills into future projects.

The functions in this project were a little hard. My brain did not want me to create a separate function for a decimal point or to round a number. It really does make it easier not only to understand my own code but to call it forward in another. Plus during debugging it makes it a lot easier to find where the issue actually is. This is definitely something I will continue to work on with future projects.
